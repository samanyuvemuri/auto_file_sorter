# Auto File Sorter

**Auto File Sorter** is a Python script that organizes files in a specified directory based on a **predefined list of folders and file types**. It helps quickly clean up messy directories like Downloads by placing files into appropriate folders.

## What It Does

- Scans a target folder.
- Uses a predefined mapping of file extensions to folder names.
- Creates the folders if they don't already exist.
- Moves matching files into their respective folders.

## How to Run

This project was developed with **Python using **Jupyter Notebook** in **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Open the notebook in VSCode with the Jupyter extension.
2. Update the `path` variable to your target directory.
3. Define your `folder_map` (e.g., mapping file extensions to folder names).
4. Run all cells to sort the files.
